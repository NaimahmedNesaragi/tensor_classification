# Purpose

This repository contains code classifying tensors using different tensor projection and classification methods. There is also code for simulating data to allow comparisons between the projection and classification methods.

# Methods
The projection methods implemented are: DATER, CMDA, DGTDA, DATER via the generalised eigenvalue problem instead of the standard eigenvalue formulation, and methods that we are proposing that optimise the objective function rigorously on a manifold and allow for objective functions assuming the PARAFAC structure.
